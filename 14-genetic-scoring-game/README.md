## Descreption:
we made a question game With unity3D with implementation from genetic Algorithms
for UI we use from unity libraries for making the interface 
we have a few scripts like for audio manager , quest manager , event System but most important script for this Course is Gamemanager we used Genetic in this script 
our genetic algo is simple we use 2 arrays for getting currect answer and wrong answer , whenever we answer wrong the next question have more score when u answer currect u get more score,
if u anwers many question wrong u will get way more score;
this is the main idea About this project
